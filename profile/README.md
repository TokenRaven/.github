Hi there, welcome at the Token Raven Github ðŸ‘‹

We are migrating from GitBook to GitHub. All our audited projects will still be available on GitBook but all new audits will be published on GitHub.

At Token Raven we stand for accurate, well-established audits

Token Raven is known for its fast response times and comprehensive crypto audits. 
The audits provided by Token Raven provide your project with a comprehensive analysis in regards to all possible vulnerabilities in your smart contracts. 
This includes warnings, typos, unused functions & variables, compiler version, centralization check and any other hazard. 
As such our report and recommendations can be used to remedy vulnerabilities.
